# BlazorNative — GitHub Project Setup Guide

This document explains how the GitHub project structure (labels, milestones,
issues, branch protection) is created and maintained — ready for community
contributions. Refreshed for the post-3.0e NativeAOT architecture at Phase 4.0.

---

## Prerequisites

**GitHub CLI** — install and authenticate:
```powershell
# Windows
winget install GitHub.cli
gh auth login
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

---

## One-command setup

From the repo root, after pushing to GitHub:

```bash
bash scripts/create-github-issues.sh
```

This creates:
- **37 labels** (phase, type, contributor difficulty)
- **7 milestones** — M1–M3 created **closed** (their descriptions link the
  final-audit docs in `docs/plans/`), M4–M7 open with the ROADMAP one-liners
- **25 open-work issues** (see issue scope below)

---

## Flags

```bash
# Preview what would be created without actually creating anything
# (needs no remote, no auth — prints the full inventory and exits 0)
bash scripts/create-github-issues.sh --dry-run

# Only create labels and milestones, skip issues
bash scripts/create-github-issues.sh --labels-only

# Override the target repo (default: MarcelRoozekrans/BlazorNative)
bash scripts/create-github-issues.sh --repo=OWNER/REPO
```

---

## Label system

### Phase labels

Phase labels map to milestones (see `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`):

| Label | Colour | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| `phase/p0` | 🔴 Red | M1 — Runtime boots end-to-end *(complete)* |
| `phase/p1` | 🟠 Orange | M2 — First end-to-end demo on Android *(complete)* |
| `phase/p2` | 🟡 Amber | M3 — Real apps can be built *(complete)* |
| `phase/p3` | 🩷 Pink | M4 — Production-shippable *(complete, `v4.0`)* |
| `phase/p4` | 🟨 Cream | M5 — Full platform coverage *(complete, `v5.0`)* |
| `phase/p5` | 🟢 Light green | M6 — Real-UI foundation: layout + scroll + image *(in progress)* |
| `phase/p6` | 🔵 Light blue | M7 — Components + Razor |
| `phase/p7` | 🟣 Lavender | M8 — Developer ecosystem |
| `phase/future` | ⚪ Grey | Long-term vision |

The milestones after M5 were **renumbered when M6 opened**: real-UI capability
(layout/scroll/image) was promoted ahead of the developer ecosystem, which moved
from M6 to M8. The table above reflects the renumbering;
`docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` is the source of truth.

Two consequences, recorded rather than silently left to be discovered:

- **M9 (Platform breadth + real device) and M10 (Framework hardening) have no
  phase label yet** — the scheme stops at `phase/p7`. They get one when they
  approach.
- `scripts/create-github-issues.sh` still *creates* `phase/p5`–`phase/p7` with
  their **pre-renumber descriptions** ("M6 — Developer ecosystem", "M7 —
  Framework hardening", "M8 — Enterprise readiness"). The labels themselves are
  already created on the repo, so this only bites on a fresh bootstrap; the
  descriptions want a pass the next time that script is touched.

### Type labels
`type/core` · `type/android` · `type/ios` · `type/renderer` · `type/components` · `type/styling` · `type/navigation` · `type/state` · `type/http` · `type/analyzer` · `type/tooling` · `type/testing` · `type/ci` · `type/docs` · `type/security` · `type/a11y` · `type/i18n` · `type/perf` · `type/memory` · `type/ota` · `type/compliance` · `type/nativeaot` · `type/nuget`

(`type/wit` was retired with the 3.0e architecture collapse; `type/nativeaot`
covers the NativeAOT publish pipeline and C-ABI export surface.)

### Contributor labels
| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `good-first-issue` | Well-scoped, good for newcomers |
| `help-wanted` | Extra attention needed from community |
| `expert-needed` | Requires deep expertise (NativeAOT, Kotlin/JNA, Blazor internals) |
| `spike` | Research / investigation required before implementation |
| `blocked` | Blocked on another issue |

---

## Issue scope: open work only

The script creates issues for **open work only** — no retro-issues for
completed M1–M3 work (those milestones are created closed, and their
descriptions link the audit record):

- **Remaining M4 phases** (4.1–4.5) — one issue each, `phase/p3`, milestone M4,
  body carries the ROADMAP phase line and links the MILESTONE.md DoD.
- **M4 DoD #4 runtime-hardening ledger** — one issue per ledger item
  (`type/core` / `type/perf`): async-handler capture window, dispatch-lane
  starvation, focus/blur wiring, stale-watcher re-attach, RemoveComponent
  bucket scan, TranslateToViewIndex memoization, RouteChanged subscriber
  isolation, allocation-budget test. Phase 4.2 triages each into
  fixed-with-tests or re-ledgered-with-rationale.
- **M5/M6 headline items** — one issue per headline item from the ROADMAP
  one-liners (`phase/p4` / `phase/p5` respectively).

M7/M8 work stays in `docs/BACKLOG.md` until those milestones approach —
this keeps the tracker focused rather than showing 170 open issues on day one.
Community members can request issues be opened for specific backlog items they
want to work on.

---

## GitHub Projects board (manual setup)

After running the script:

1. Go to the repo owner's profile → **Projects** → **New project**
2. Choose **Board** view
3. Name it `BlazorNative Roadmap`
4. Add columns: `Backlog` · `Up Next` · `In Progress` · `Done`
5. Filter by milestone to see each phase separately
6. Pin the board to the repo

---

## Recommended repo settings

### Branch protection (main)

Applied at Phase 4.0 Gate 5, **immediately after the public flip**, via `gh api`.
(Gate 4 deviation, discovered live: branch protection on a *private* repo
requires GitHub Pro on personal accounts — on the free plan it is available
only for public repos. Protection therefore lands right after the repo goes
public, before the phase closes.)

- Require PR before merging (no direct pushes to `main`, admins included)
- Required status checks — **all three jobs of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**:
  - **`build-test`** (windows-latest) — build + analyzers, the .NET test suite,
    the three NativeAOT publishes with nine-export verification, JVM
    `testDebugUnitTest`, consumer smoke, and the `.so` artifact uploads (kept so
    a **human** can download and inspect a build's binaries — **no job consumes
    them**; see the note under the three bullets).

    > **Local IL2072 counts: publish from clean.** The publish gates assert
    > **exactly 4** IL2072 trim warnings — but an *incremental* local
    > re-publish can show **0**, because ILC skips trim analysis when its
    > inputs are unchanged since the last publish. That 0 is not drift and
    > not a fix; delete the publish `obj/bin` (or `git clean`) and re-publish
    > to see the real count. CI is unaffected — every run is a clean
    > checkout. (Phase 8.0 review M-2, recorded here.)
  - **`android-build`** (windows-latest, **no `needs:`**) — the **Android
    shell's compile**. It **self-publishes** `linux-bionic-x64` the proven way
    (windows-latest with the pinned NDK) and points the verify/copy chain at its
    own publish tree via `-PciSoDir` — it downloads nothing. Then `gradlew
    compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin`, type-checking `src/androidMain/kotlin`
    (MainActivity, WidgetMapper, YogaLayout) **and** the instrumented
    `androidTest` source set. No emulator is booted; no test is run.
  - **`ios-build`** (macos-latest) — the **iOS shell's compile**: publish
    `iossimulator-arm64`, build the pinned Yoga from source, then `xcodebuild
    build-for-testing` (Swift + Objective-C++ compiled, app **and** XCTest bundle
    linked). No simulator is booted; no test is run.
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- No force pushes

> **The three required jobs are INDEPENDENT — `ci.yml` declares no `needs:` edges
> at all.** They run in parallel, and each does its own checkout and its own
> publish. Nothing in `ci.yml` downloads an artifact: `build-test`'s `.so`
> uploads are there to be downloaded by a *person*, not by a job. The repo's one
> long-standing cross-job artifact hand-off is in `android-instrumented.yml`
> (`publish-so` → `emulator`, the **advisory nightly** lane); `release.yml`'s

> previously described `android-build` as "ubuntu-latest, `needs: build-test`",
> compiling against a `.so` `build-test` uploads. It has never been any of those
> things, and the same false belief is what produced review finding I-3.)*

> **All three check names are exactly the job ids** — `build-test`,
> `android-build` and `ios-build` — because no job declares a `name:` and none is
> a matrix.

> **`release.yml` adds no fourth required check, by design (Phase 8.2).** Its

> names and contexts are a standing constraint.

Each native shell now has a distinctly-named required compile gate: a red
`android-build` names the Android shell, a red `ios-build` names the iOS shell.
The Android compile used to ride inside `build-test` (PR #81), where an Android
shell that stopped compiling reddened the same check as a .NET build error, a
.NET test failure or a JVM unit-test failure — you could not tell which shell
broke. It was split into `android-build` for that legibility (symmetric with
`ios-build`), and the gate is otherwise identical: *a device is needed to RUN the
instrumented tests, not to COMPILE them*.

#### Why `ios-build` is required and `ios` is not

The AGP 9 migration proved that **an assertion can be green and structurally
unreachable**: `android-instrumented` asserted 111 passing tests while
`src/androidMain/kotlin` — the entire Android shell — was not being compiled at
all, because that lane does not gate PRs. It landed on `main` green. PR #81 closed
it by compiling the instrumented sources inside `build-test`; the M6 audit then
split that gate into its own required job, **`android-build`**, so a red check
names the Android shell directly (see the required-checks list above).

The M6 final audit (finding F1) found the iOS shell in the same hole and deeper:
`build-test` runs on Windows and contains no Apple toolchain, so **no required
check compiled a single line of Swift or Objective-C++**, and `ios.yml` is
advisory. `ios-build` is the mirror of #81's fix — *a device is needed to RUN the
tests, not to COMPILE them* — and it is deliberately the **honest intersection**:
the part with no simulator flake modes, made required. Simulator **execution**
stays in `ios.yml` and stays advisory.

#### The two advisory lanes, and what promotes them

The instrumented-emulator workflow (`android-instrumented.yml`, nightly
03:00 UTC + manual dispatch) is **informational, not a required check** —
emulator-on-CI has known flake modes; it stays advisory until a stability
baseline exists (several consecutive green nightly runs), at which point it
can be promoted to a required check. Only the device **execution** is advisory:
the Android shell's **compile** is required, in `android-build` (above), exactly
as the iOS shell's compile is required in `ios-build` while its simulator
execution stays advisory in `ios.yml`. Shape: a `publish-so` job on
windows-latest publishes the linux-bionic-x64 `.so` (same pinned-NDK,
IL2072 and nine-export assertions as `ci.yml`) and hands it as an artifact
to an `emulator` job on ubuntu-latest (KVM), which runs
`connectedAndroidTest -PciSoDir=<artifact dir>` on an API 34 google_apis
x86_64 Pixel 6 image — mirroring the local AVD `blazornative-pixel6-x86_64`
— and asserts the count pinned in the workflow itself (see the provenance
block in `android-instrumented.yml` for the current bar and its history).

The iOS-simulator workflow (`ios.yml`, `macos-latest`, on `push` to `main` +
manual dispatch — **the `pull_request` trigger was removed in Phase 7.6** on an
owner cost request; PRs keep the REQUIRED `ios-build` compile gate, the phase
process dispatches this lane at every iOS gate, and every merge runs it on
`main`; the workflow header records the condition for restoring the PR trigger)
is likewise **informational, not a required check** — simulator-on-CI has flake
modes (sim boot, test-host launch), so it stays advisory. Promotion mirrors the
emulator lane: after a stability baseline (≈10 consecutive green runs on `main`
with no sim-flake reds) it can be promoted to a required check. Shape: a
**single** job (iOS both publishes and tests on macOS) publishes the
`iossimulator-arm64` NativeAOT **static** archive (the runtime-pack bypass +
`NativeLib=Static`; 4 IL2072 + nine-export `nm -gU` assertions), assembles the
static-embed link inputs (`bootstrapperdll.o` direct-link + the merged support
archive), then runs the hosted XCTest suite via `xcodebuild test` on a
runner-selected simulator — asserting the count pinned in `ios.yml`'s own
provenance block. The suite covers the render pin and the wire-drift guard; the
interactive demo (bind/echo, Clear, Theme, Settings⇄Back, clipboard); the Yoga
layer (style parsing, node lifecycle, dirty-on-change, resize); and — the point of
M6 — the **computed-frame assertions** for `BnLayoutDemo`, `BnScrollDemo` and
`BnImageDemo`, which pin *the same numbers* the Android instrumented lane asserts.
(That "same numbers" is itself pinned, in the required lane, by
`ShellFrameTableDriftTests` — see below.)

> **`ios.yml` had no `push` trigger and a `paths:` filter until the M6-audit fix.**
> It therefore never ran on `main` at all, and a PR that broke the Swift shell from
> a non-Apple path (`tests/**`, `scripts/**`, `Directory.Build.props`) did not even
> run the lane. Both are gone. Public-repo macOS minutes are free; the filter bought
> nothing but a blind spot with a green tick on it.

#### The cross-shell contracts live in the required lane

Neither shell's own lane can see the other's source (the Android lane has no Xcode;
the iOS lane has no Gradle). `build-test` can see **both, plus .NET** — it is the
only lane where all three languages are checkout-visible — so every cross-language
contract in this repo is pinned there, as a test that parses the shells' sources as
text:

- `ShellStyleTableDriftTests` — the Yoga style routing tables and the scroll
  ignore-lists (Kotlin ↔ `.mm` ↔ `NativeRenderer`).
- `ShellFrameTableDriftTests` — **the demo pages' canonical frame tables**. Both
  shells declare them in one machine-readable file each
  (`BnDemoFrameTables.kt` / `BnDemoFrameTables.swift`); this demands they be equal,
  number for number. "Identical frames on both platforms" is M6's entire
  architectural claim, and until the audit's finding F2 it was held by careful
  transcription rather than by an invariant.
- `BnImageDemoTests` — the image fixtures' natural pixel sizes, across .NET, the
  Kotlin fixture server and the Swift one.
- The Yoga version pin — asserted equal across `build.gradle.kts`, `ios.yml` and
  `ci.yml`'s own `YOGA_VERSION` (which is what `ios-build` compiles).

### Secrets — `NUGET_API_KEY`, the one secret

**This repository needs exactly one secret, and it is the only thing standing
between the packages and nuget.org.** Everything else the release does is
computed from the tree.

**Minting it** (nuget.org → your avatar → **API Keys** → **Create**):

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Key name | `BlazorNative CI` | anything; it is for your own audit trail |
| Scopes | **Push new packages and package versions** only | not *Unlist*; the workflow never unlists |
| Glob pattern | `BlazorNative.*` | the key cannot touch a package outside this project even if it leaks |
| Expiration | 365 days (max) | put the renewal in a calendar; an expired key surfaces as a 401 on a Release |

**Where it goes:** repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
→ **New repository secret** → name it **exactly** `NUGET_API_KEY` (the workflow
reads that name and nothing else).

**The standing law, and it is a test rather than a promise:** the key is
referenced by **exactly one job in exactly one workflow** — `release.yml`'s
`push` job, guarded on `github.event_name == 'release'`. `ReleaseWorkflowPinTests`
reds the **required** `build-test` lane if a second reference ever appears
anywhere under `.github/workflows/`. So this is a complete answer — grep for the
**expression**, not the bare name (`release.yml`'s own comments discuss the
secret by name; only the `${{ … }}` form can actually read it, and only that form
is what the pin counts):

```bash
grep -rF '${{ secrets.NUGET_API_KEY }}' .github/   # exactly one hit — that hit is the door
```

> **Scoping, and the residual we accept.** A repo-level secret is readable by
> any workflow run on a branch by an actor with write access. A GitHub
> *environment* with a branch restriction would narrow that — it is deliberately
> **not** used, because the owner's law is *one secret, and the Release is the
> go*, and an environment gate is a **second** manual approval on an action that
> is already manual. The mitigations that cost nothing are taken: one reference,
> one job, `if:`-guarded, pinned by a test.

### GitHub Pages — enabling the docs site

**This repository needs exactly one click, and it is the only thing standing
between `website/` and a live docs site.** There is no secret, no token, no
branch, and nothing to mint: `docs.yml` authenticates to Pages with an OIDC
`id-token` the workflow already requests. The `github-pages` environment is
created **automatically** on the first deploy.

**Where it goes:** repo → **Settings** → **Pages** → **Build and deployment** →
**Source** → select **`GitHub Actions`**.

That is the whole list. Verify it took:

```bash
gh api repos/MarcelRoozekrans/BlazorNative/pages --jq .build_type   # → workflow
```

Before the click that endpoint is a **404** (`has_pages: false`), which is itself
the check — a 404 means the setting has not been made. The target state is what
`AdoNet.Async` already shows: `build_type: "workflow"`.

**What happens after.** `docs.yml` `build` → `deploy` runs on every push to
`main`, and the site lands at
**<https://marcelroozekrans.github.io/BlazorNative/>**.

**Its paths filter is deliberately wider than `website/**`, and that is the part
to understand rather than to memorize.** The component reference is *generated*
from `src/BlazorNative.Components`' XML doc comments at build time — so a PR that
improves a `<summary>`, or that changes whether those doc comments exist at all,
changes the site without touching `website/`. Under a `website/**`-only filter
main would take that commit and never redeploy, serving a stale reference with
nothing red anywhere, for exactly as long as nobody looked. So the filter names
every input the reference is a function of: the components, the two props/targets
files that decide whether the XML is generated and whether CS1591 is an error,
the generator script, its tool manifest, and the workflow itself.

**The executable truth is `.github/workflows/docs.yml`, job `build` — read the
`paths:` lists there rather than a copy here.** There are two of them (the `push`
filter and the `pull_request` filter): GitHub Actions supports no YAML anchors, so
they are duplicated by construction and must be edited together. A transcription
on this page would be a third copy that rots the day either list moves.

`docs.yml` also builds on `pull_request` (a broken docs build is caught before it
lands), with `deploy` gated off `pull_request` so a PR never touches Pages, never
takes the `pages` concurrency group, and never needs `id-token`. It is
**advisory** — it is not a required check, and `build-test` / `android-build` /
`ios-build` keep their names and contexts.

**Until the click, `deploy` fails** — loudly, on `main`, with a legible Pages
error. Everything already re-pointed at the site 404s in that interval: the six
packages' READMEs, `PackageProjectUrl`, and the analyzers' `helpLinkUri` values.
That is bounded and it is strictly better than the alternative — nothing
publishes without your Release (so no consumer can reach those URLs first), and
the old targets are a 404 *forever*.

> ⚠ **The first check after clicking is a LOOK, not a red.** This is the quiet
> arrow, and it is the one thing on this page that CI cannot catch for you. The
> site's `baseUrl` (`'/BlazorNative/'` in `website/docusaurus.config.js`) is only
> correct relative to where Pages actually serves it. **A wrong `baseUrl` builds
> green, deploys green, and reports success** — and produces a page with dead CSS
> and 404 links. No local build and no workflow can see it; only a real fetch of
> the real URL can. So after the first deploy goes green, **open
> <https://marcelroozekrans.github.io/BlazorNative/> and confirm it has
> styling.** Green is not the evidence here; your eyes are.

---

### Publishing a release (the manual go)

**Nothing publishes from a merge. Nothing publishes from a tag. Publishing a
GitHub Release is the go, and it is the only one.**

**Two disjoint tag namespaces — this is the part to read before you need it:**

| Tag | Means | Publishes? |
|---|---|---|
| `v<N>.<M>` — `v1.0` … `v8.0` | **milestone** (seven exist; none has ever carried a Release) | **never** |
| `pkg/<semver>` — `pkg/1.0.0-preview.1` | **package release** | **the only shape that does** |

A Release published on **`v8.0`** — the M8 close tag, and the most natural first
Release anyone would publish here — **publishes nothing**, says so in the run
summary, and exits green. That is by design, not a bug: the `release` event has
no tag filter, so *every* published Release fires the workflow, and the
classifier is what decides that a milestone announcement announces.

**The ritual:**

1. **Bump the version** — one line, `<Version>` in `src/Directory.Build.props`.
   It is the *only* place a version lives (pinned by `PackageVersionPinTests`).
2. **PR it, and let CI go green.** The release lane (`release.yml`'s `validate`
   job) runs on this PR automatically — it is paths-filtered to the props and
   the release machinery, so a version bump is exactly when it fires. It asks
   nuget.org whether your new version is still free.
3. **Merge.**
4. **Tag the merge commit** and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag pkg/1.0.0-preview.2 <merge sha>
   git push origin pkg/1.0.0-preview.2
   ```
   *Pushing the tag publishes nothing.* It only creates something to point a
   Release at.
5. **GitHub → Releases → Draft a new release** → pick the `pkg/<version>` tag →
   **write the body**. The body **is the changelog** — it is written at the
   moment of the go, by the person deciding to go, and it is what a consumer
   following the nuget.org project link lands on. There is no `CHANGELOG.md` by
   decision.
6. **Publish.** That click is the go. `validate` runs every check with no key in
   the run at all; only then does `push` see the secret.

**Three things that will otherwise surprise you:**

- **The tag is a claim; the props wins.** The workflow *asserts* that
  `pkg/1.0.0-preview.2` matches the props and **never overrides it**. Tag ahead
  of props, props ahead of tag, tag on the wrong commit — all three are RED,
  naming both values. (Overriding via `-p:Version=` would make the packages
  irreproducible from the commit they name; it is banned and pinned.)
- **Recovery from a partial push is an Actions re-run, NOT a Release edit.**
  Three packages up and three failed is recoverable: **re-run the `push` job
  from the Actions UI** — `--skip-duplicate` makes the three that landed
  no-ops. Editing and re-publishing the Release fires `edited`, **not**
  `published`, so the workflow will *not* re-fire.
- **A published version can never be replaced.** nuget.org has **no hard
  delete** — only *unlist*. If a wrong version publishes, the recovery is
  unlist → bump → release again. It is never "fix it and re-push the same
  version". That single fact is why every check runs before the key.

#### What the first Release is actually testing

Honesty about the machinery, because **the release mechanism is the one thing in
this repo that cannot be tested by using it** — there is no key, no throwaway
registry, and no publish until you publish. Everything provable is proven on
every PR; what remains is listed here rather than implied. **Every arrow below
fails in the safe direction — nothing publishes — and announces itself to you,
standing there having just clicked Publish.**

| # | Unproven until your first Release | If it is wrong, you see |
|---|---|---|
| U1 | `release: types: [published]` actually fires the workflow | **Nothing happens** — no run appears. Safe: it cannot mis-publish. (`actionlint` proves the event *name* is real; that GitHub *fires* it is what a Release proves.) |
| U2 | `NUGET_API_KEY` resolves — present and correctly named | A named RED: *"NUGET_API_KEY is unset or misnamed — see docs/GITHUB-SETUP.md"*, instead of a bare 401 from a CLI |
| U3 | nuget.org **accepts** these nupkgs — no reserved-prefix 403 | A 403 or an async validation failure on first push. All six ids are unregistered today, so nothing is reserved — but a reserved-prefix answer cannot be obtained without a key |
| U4 | The adjacent `.snupkg` reaches the symbol server | Packages publish, symbols silently do not. **Recoverable** — symbols can be pushed later |
| U5 | `--skip-duplicate` no-ops a real 409 | A re-run reds instead of skipping. Recoverable by hand |
| U6 | Six pushes across a minutes-wide async indexing window behave | A consumer restoring inside the window sees an unindexed dependency. **Self-healing** |
| U7 | The **artifact hand-off** from `validate` to `push` carries the packed feed | The upload is `release`-gated, so **no PR can exercise it** — only a real Release does. A loud RED: *"ZERO .nupkg found — the artifact hand-off from validate is broken"*. That guard exists so this fails **loudly** instead of pushing nothing and going green. Safe: nothing publishes. (Same actions and versions as `publish-so → emulator` in the nightly `android-instrumented.yml`, which runs this shape every night.) |
| U8 | `needs.validate.outputs.verdict` **reaches the `push` job** | This is the repo's **first** `needs.<job>.outputs` consumer — no other lane uses one. If it is wrong, the value is empty, the `if:` is false, and **`push` skips silently** — safe (nothing publishes) but **quiet**: you would see a *skipped* job, not a red one. So check that `push` actually ran. `actionlint` statically rules out every **typo** shape *in this chain* (job-output names, step ids, `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>`, and `needs:` itself — all mutant-tested), so "is it spelled right" is settled; what a Release proves is that the runtime does what the syntax says |

**The blast radius of the first firing is one unlistable preview of a package
nobody depends on yet** — which is the cheapest possible way to learn all eight of
these at once, and it is cheap *on purpose*.

> **All eight fail in the safe direction — nothing publishes — and seven of them
> say so loudly. U8 is the one quiet failure**: an empty verdict skips `push`
> rather than reddening it. So when you publish the first Release, the check is
> **"did `push` actually run?"**, not just "was there a red?". *(U7 and U8 were
> added by the Phase 8.2 Gate 1 review, finding I-2: both are arrows no PR can
> exercise, and a table that omitted them was claiming more coverage than the
> lane has.)*

### PR-merge workflow (from Phase 4.1 onward)

Once branch protection is live, phases merge **via PR** instead of a local
`merge --no-ff`:

1. Work happens on a phase branch (`phase-N.N-description`), same as before.
2. `gh pr create` targeting `main`; the phase's review checkpoints happen
   against the PR.
3. CI (`ci / build-test` **and** `ci / ios-build`) must be green and
   conversations resolved.
4. Merge on GitHub (`gh pr merge --merge` — keep the merge commit; the
   per-phase merge points remain the project's history spine).

Same review rhythm as M1–M3 — the merge just happens on GitHub with CI as the
gate.

### Issue templates

Live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:
- `bug_report.md` — for bugs
- `feature_request.md` — for new features outside the roadmap
- `platform_api.md` — for new platform API proposals (camera, GPS, etc.),
  framed around the host-registered C-ABI bridge

### PR template

Lives at `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The platform checklist matches the
surfaces every change must hold on — the iOS row joined in M5 once the Swift
shell landed (render in Phase 5.2, interactivity in Phase 5.3):

```markdown
## Platform tested
- [ ] JVM dev loop (`testDebugUnitTest`)
- [ ] Android emulator (`connectedAndroidTest`)
- [ ] iOS simulator (`ios.yml` — `xcodebuild test`)
```

## Attracting contributors

Once the repo is public with the issue structure:

1. **Write a good README** — the current `README.md` reflects the NativeAOT
   architecture; keep the badge and status banner current
2. **Add to awesome lists:**
   - [awesome-blazor](https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor)
   - [awesome-dotnet](https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet)
3. **Post on:**
   - r/dotnet, r/Blazor, r/androiddev
   - Hacker News (Show HN — the two-page native demo app is the hook)
   - .NET Foundation Discord
   - Blazor Discord
4. **Tag issues with `good-first-issue`** — GitHub surfaces these to new contributors automatically
5. **Respond fast** — first-time contributors drop off if they don't hear back within 48 hours
